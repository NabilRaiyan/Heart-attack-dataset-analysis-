# Heart Disease Prediction Project
<h1>Overview</h1>
This project aims to predict heart disease based on a dataset with 12 attributes and 150 instances. The attributes include Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholesterol, FastingBS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, Oldpeak, ST_Slope, and HeartDisease. The dataset provides insights into the heart condition and allows the prediction of heart disease based on age, gender, and other factors.

<h1>Dataset Information</h1>
1. Age: Age of the individual.
2. Sex: Gender of the individual (male/female).
3. ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced by the individual.
4. RestingBP: Resting blood pressure.
5. Cholesterol: Cholesterol levels.
6. FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar levels.
7. RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results.
8. MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
9. ExerciseAngina: Presence of exercise-induced angina.
10. Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
12. HeartDisease: Presence or absence of heart disease (target variable).

<h1>Usage</h1>
This dataset can be used for exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to predict heart disease based on various features. The project may include data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
